      "content": "A Little About Us...\n\n\nAt Rupa Health (www.rupahealth.com), we’re on a mission to fundamentally improve the health of every person on the planet. We see functional medicine as the missing piece for millions of people suffering from chronic health conditions. That’s why we are committed to creating the technology for this thriving area of scientifically-backed integrative healthcare. We’re building the infrastructure for the next generation of medicine.\n\n\nOur first product is the Rupa Labs portal. Rupa Labs makes it super simple for functional medicine practitioners to order, dispense, and receive results from 20+ lab companies in one place. It is essential infrastructure for functional medicine practitioners, turning an archaic 15 hour-a-week process into a delightful 15 min task. With Rupa, practitioners can get back to what’s important - helping people get well!\n\n\nWe’re backed by and work closely with our world class investors: First Round Capital, Mike Maples / Floodgate, Ron Conway / SV Angel, Joe Montana, Hustle Fund, healthcare domain experts, former founders with successful exits, the product brains behind Gmail, Facebook newsfeed, Dropbox, and more.\n\n\nWe’re also fortunate to be advised by the best in the industry, including the Head of Health and co-founder of IDEO, the co-founder of Honor HomeCare, domain experts with backgrounds from Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Johns Hopkins, and more.\n\n\nWe’ve been growing like crazy this year, with exponential month-over-month growth. To help fuel this rapid growth we’ve recently closed a round from First Round Capital, one of the top venture capital firms in the world.\n\n\nA company is only as good as its people, and so we’re looking for a Head of Marketing who can join us on this fast-paced journey.\n\n\nSo, what’s the role?\n\n\nYou’ll be joining the Rupa Health product and engineering team! We’re a close-knit, scrappy, and hardworking small team, and that means we’re looking for talented engineers who can offer more than just code. You’ll work closely with the founding team to iterate on the Rupa Labs portal and build delightful new features for our practitioners and patients. There’s a lot of unexplored territory in this space, and we’ll be relying on your ingenuity and problem-solving skills to come up with novel solutions that can scale. We’ll also be looking for you to provide your thoughts on the product direction and UX design.\n\n\nAs an early engineer, you’ll be able to grow as a leader in your role and define the technical direction and vision for the company. You’ll have a lot of autonomy, responsibility, and ownership. You’ll also help define and contribute to the culture of the company as a whole. You’ll be working directly with our technical co-founder who has 10+ years of experience coding, founding startups, and building multiple products in the health / wellness space.\n\n\nWhat we're looking for\n\n\n- At least 3-5 years of professional software engineering experience creating frontend and backend applications.\n\n- Ready and able to jump straight into building in ReactJS and Django. Ideally you have experience with AWS and Postgres too.\n\n- Experience working in other early-stage tech startups. Bonus points if you’ve been a founder!\n\n- Ability to move fast and write code with a startup mindset.\n\n- Being able to take a broadly defined task and implement it without every aspect being laid out for you.\n\n- Security-by-design mindset. Let’s keep our patients’ data safe.\n\n- A passion for functional medicine and creating the infrastructure for the future of healthcare.\n\n\nCurrent Team\n\n\nYou’ll be joining our all-star founding team who have 10+ years experience in the space, have won awards for their biotech research, worked hands on with chronically ill patients, and much more. The founding team comes from Stanford, Wharton, Parsley Health, Lululemon, Everlywell, Coffee Meets Bagel and more. We each have very personal reasons for wanting to transform this space. We’ve experienced firsthand the impact functional medicine can have and are committed to this cause.\n\n\nBeyond our collective excitement for the space, we’re a super close team who values personal development, being active, growth mindsets, a great sense of humor, and a healthy balance of optimism and realism. We work hard and have a ton of fun. 🙌\n\n\nIf this sounds like you, we’re stoked to meet you!\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$45.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 04, 2021 23:40 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Web Application,     React,     Python,     Django,     PostgreSQL,     Very Small (1-9 employees),     Startup    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/React-Python-Django-expert-join-health-tech-startup-hours-week_%7E016b78702368fe7f27?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

The code sits within my teams Azure DevOps Source Control system (formerly Visual Studio Online / TFS Online). The project is split in to two repositories with two different source control branches.\n\n\nSo, FINALLY we need your help in executing the changes we want to see in the attachment PDF..  If so, we were hoping to have live by next week\n\n<b>Budget</b>: $600\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 04, 2021 17:23 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Front-End Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Web Design,     HTML,     CSS,     Website,     WordPress Website,     WordPress,     Bootstrap,     Redesigned Website    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Edits-headless-Wordpress_%7E01366889090bcb36e4?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "About Us:\n\nWe are highly experienced technical people with decades of experience in network management. We are focused on building a network testing system called SEAssure that allows other companies to test their communication networks. We have built an MVP for the SEAssure API already in past few months.\n\n\nWhat we need:\n\nWe require assistance in building a WebPortal on top of our SEAssure API to show usage of the system. This would allow our customers to have a UI/UX for using our API without doing any development.\n\n\nWe have a backend system called SEAssure that provides the following APIs:\n\n\n- A secure API that is used to request testing of communications network quality.\n\n- The SEAssure system returns back the test result via a callback after the test is completed.\n\n- SEAssure also has API to create new customers for the API and generate access keys for using the API.\n\n- Backend should be able to manage user signups and login as in every generic web portal.\n\n\nAll in all there are 6 endpoints in the API at this moment in phase 1.\n\n\nWhat we need is a BackendForFrontend (BFF) and a FrontEnd itself which means full stack development.\n\nThe basic requirements of the system are:\n\n1- Users can signup using email/password combination.\n\n2- Users can request a new password in case forgotten.\n\n3- System can generate access keys for the SEAssure API for the user and stores it securely. (We can guide on how to do that).\n\n4- System allows a simple form to create a test and call the SEAssureAPI endpoint.\n\n5- System is able to receive callback and store the result of the test for that user and for that specific test.\n\n6- A reporting page where users can see all the test results in a tabular form. Nothing fancy in this phase.\n\n7- Using SEAssure API to list the networks available for testing.\n\n\nWhat we provide:\n\nWe will assist in creating the DBSchema for this backend. We will also provide guidance on secure storage of credentials (API access keys).\n\nWe have written detailed product specifications with wireframes, personas, API specifications and functional/non-functional requirements. We will provide this document after selecting the developer(s) and would require to sign an NDA.\n\n\nDeliverables:\n\nWe would need the code to be preferably built with Python + Django.\n\nIt is important that code is clean and extensible as we expect more development to occur over time.\n\nWe recommend using a bootstrap or other template for HTML components rather than building your own from scratch. ReactJS is not needed but if the developer thinks it is useful then a case can be made.\n\nWe would like the code to be deployable in a docker container with external DB connection but during development a simple docker-compose script will be enough with a local DB.\n\nWe would give access to our project's slack channel as a guest to communicate faster on the project.\n\n<b>Budget</b>: $500\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 02, 2021 11:15 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:API,     Web Application,     Django,     Python,     MariaDB,     MySQL,     HTML,     CSS,     Bootstrap    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Netherlands\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/WebPortal-for-Network-Testing-API-Phase_%7E019bcb4c592f9a9bec?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",
