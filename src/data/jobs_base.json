      "content": "A Little About Us...\n\n\nAt Rupa Health (www.rupahealth.com), we’re on a mission to fundamentally improve the health of every person on the planet. We see functional medicine as the missing piece for millions of people suffering from chronic health conditions. That’s why we are committed to creating the technology for this thriving area of scientifically-backed integrative healthcare. We’re building the infrastructure for the next generation of medicine.\n\n\nOur first product is the Rupa Labs portal. Rupa Labs makes it super simple for functional medicine practitioners to order, dispense, and receive results from 20+ lab companies in one place. It is essential infrastructure for functional medicine practitioners, turning an archaic 15 hour-a-week process into a delightful 15 min task. With Rupa, practitioners can get back to what’s important - helping people get well!\n\n\nWe’re backed by and work closely with our world class investors: First Round Capital, Mike Maples / Floodgate, Ron Conway / SV Angel, Joe Montana, Hustle Fund, healthcare domain experts, former founders with successful exits, the product brains behind Gmail, Facebook newsfeed, Dropbox, and more.\n\n\nWe’re also fortunate to be advised by the best in the industry, including the Head of Health and co-founder of IDEO, the co-founder of Honor HomeCare, domain experts with backgrounds from Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Johns Hopkins, and more.\n\n\nWe’ve been growing like crazy this year, with exponential month-over-month growth. To help fuel this rapid growth we’ve recently closed a round from First Round Capital, one of the top venture capital firms in the world.\n\n\nA company is only as good as its people, and so we’re looking for a Head of Marketing who can join us on this fast-paced journey.\n\n\nSo, what’s the role?\n\n\nYou’ll be joining the Rupa Health product and engineering team! We’re a close-knit, scrappy, and hardworking small team, and that means we’re looking for talented engineers who can offer more than just code. You’ll work closely with the founding team to iterate on the Rupa Labs portal and build delightful new features for our practitioners and patients. There’s a lot of unexplored territory in this space, and we’ll be relying on your ingenuity and problem-solving skills to come up with novel solutions that can scale. We’ll also be looking for you to provide your thoughts on the product direction and UX design.\n\n\nAs an early engineer, you’ll be able to grow as a leader in your role and define the technical direction and vision for the company. You’ll have a lot of autonomy, responsibility, and ownership. You’ll also help define and contribute to the culture of the company as a whole. You’ll be working directly with our technical co-founder who has 10+ years of experience coding, founding startups, and building multiple products in the health / wellness space.\n\n\nWhat we're looking for\n\n\n- At least 3-5 years of professional software engineering experience creating frontend and backend applications.\n\n- Ready and able to jump straight into building in ReactJS and Django. Ideally you have experience with AWS and Postgres too.\n\n- Experience working in other early-stage tech startups. Bonus points if you’ve been a founder!\n\n- Ability to move fast and write code with a startup mindset.\n\n- Being able to take a broadly defined task and implement it without every aspect being laid out for you.\n\n- Security-by-design mindset. Let’s keep our patients’ data safe.\n\n- A passion for functional medicine and creating the infrastructure for the future of healthcare.\n\n\nCurrent Team\n\n\nYou’ll be joining our all-star founding team who have 10+ years experience in the space, have won awards for their biotech research, worked hands on with chronically ill patients, and much more. The founding team comes from Stanford, Wharton, Parsley Health, Lululemon, Everlywell, Coffee Meets Bagel and more. We each have very personal reasons for wanting to transform this space. We’ve experienced firsthand the impact functional medicine can have and are committed to this cause.\n\n\nBeyond our collective excitement for the space, we’re a super close team who values personal development, being active, growth mindsets, a great sense of humor, and a healthy balance of optimism and realism. We work hard and have a ton of fun. 🙌\n\n\nIf this sounds like you, we’re stoked to meet you!\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$45.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 04, 2021 23:40 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Web Application,     React,     Python,     Django,     PostgreSQL,     Very Small (1-9 employees),     Startup    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/React-Python-Django-expert-join-health-tech-startup-hours-week_%7E016b78702368fe7f27?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

The code sits within my teams Azure DevOps Source Control system (formerly Visual Studio Online / TFS Online). The project is split in to two repositories with two different source control branches.\n\n\nSo, FINALLY we need your help in executing the changes we want to see in the attachment PDF..  If so, we were hoping to have live by next week\n\n<b>Budget</b>: $600\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 04, 2021 17:23 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Front-End Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Web Design,     HTML,     CSS,     Website,     WordPress Website,     WordPress,     Bootstrap,     Redesigned Website    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Edits-headless-Wordpress_%7E01366889090bcb36e4?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "About Us:\n\nWe are highly experienced technical people with decades of experience in network management. We are focused on building a network testing system called SEAssure that allows other companies to test their communication networks. We have built an MVP for the SEAssure API already in past few months.\n\n\nWhat we need:\n\nWe require assistance in building a WebPortal on top of our SEAssure API to show usage of the system. This would allow our customers to have a UI/UX for using our API without doing any development.\n\n\nWe have a backend system called SEAssure that provides the following APIs:\n\n\n- A secure API that is used to request testing of communications network quality.\n\n- The SEAssure system returns back the test result via a callback after the test is completed.\n\n- SEAssure also has API to create new customers for the API and generate access keys for using the API.\n\n- Backend should be able to manage user signups and login as in every generic web portal.\n\n\nAll in all there are 6 endpoints in the API at this moment in phase 1.\n\n\nWhat we need is a BackendForFrontend (BFF) and a FrontEnd itself which means full stack development.\n\nThe basic requirements of the system are:\n\n1- Users can signup using email/password combination.\n\n2- Users can request a new password in case forgotten.\n\n3- System can generate access keys for the SEAssure API for the user and stores it securely. (We can guide on how to do that).\n\n4- System allows a simple form to create a test and call the SEAssureAPI endpoint.\n\n5- System is able to receive callback and store the result of the test for that user and for that specific test.\n\n6- A reporting page where users can see all the test results in a tabular form. Nothing fancy in this phase.\n\n7- Using SEAssure API to list the networks available for testing.\n\n\nWhat we provide:\n\nWe will assist in creating the DBSchema for this backend. We will also provide guidance on secure storage of credentials (API access keys).\n\nWe have written detailed product specifications with wireframes, personas, API specifications and functional/non-functional requirements. We will provide this document after selecting the developer(s) and would require to sign an NDA.\n\n\nDeliverables:\n\nWe would need the code to be preferably built with Python + Django.\n\nIt is important that code is clean and extensible as we expect more development to occur over time.\n\nWe recommend using a bootstrap or other template for HTML components rather than building your own from scratch. ReactJS is not needed but if the developer thinks it is useful then a case can be made.\n\nWe would like the code to be deployable in a docker container with external DB connection but during development a simple docker-compose script will be enough with a local DB.\n\nWe would give access to our project's slack channel as a guest to communicate faster on the project.\n\n<b>Budget</b>: $500\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 02, 2021 11:15 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:API,     Web Application,     Django,     Python,     MariaDB,     MySQL,     HTML,     CSS,     Bootstrap    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Netherlands\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/WebPortal-for-Network-Testing-API-Phase_%7E019bcb4c592f9a9bec?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "Hi, \n\n\nWe are a freight brokerage company that works with numerous shippers and carriers. We want to develop our own platform to compete with Platforms such as DAT load board and convoy. This industry has a lot of flaws and inconsistencies and one that needs disruption.  The platform's job is to make freight seamless to deal with by incorporating technology. Somethings we want to incorporate into the platforms are Live load tracking, Carriers, and shippers should be able to see the status of the load live. We want to use an AI to determine shipment pricing instantly, this way it eliminates back and forth phone calls or emails. Pricing for shipments should be seamless for our shippers or co brokers. We want to also use Ai to connect empty trailers to carriers. For Ex: Shipper ABC needs to move the empty trailer from NY to CA, within 1 week. But to pay a lot of money for the empty trailer is not economically viable for the shipper. So the solution is our carrier will pick up the empty trailer and use the trailer to haul loads from a different shipper that is going to CA from NY. This can enable loads to be covered instantly for carriers and shippers. There a lot of complexity involved in the project that we can discuss in detail. Just for reference check out websites such as convoy or Coyote logistics and DAT load board. We want to make shipping as easy as it can get. The design should be very modern and simplistic. The USE of AI is vital in this project, so expertise in AI is a must!\n\n\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $22.00-$60.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 01, 2021 14:00 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Digital Marketing\n<b>Skills</b>:Website Development,     Web Design,     Logistics & Shipping,     Freight Forwarding,     Mobile App Development,     Python,     Java,     C,     C++,     Android App Development,     iOS Development,     Artificial Neural Networks,     AI,     Artificial Intelligence    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Digital-Freight-Network_%7E018324aa7da75e3c12?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "we have a set of POJO models, with mandatory fields and dependencies on each other. For example:\n\n\nclass Client\n\n{​\n\n    @NotBlank\n\n    string Name;\n\n    Address homeAddress;\n\n    List&lt;Order&gt; orders;\n\n}​\n\n\netc.\n\n\nAs step 1 (this project), we need to create a relatively generic workflow which will allow us to enter all this data via &quot;generic&quot; input/output way. For example, one way to look at it would be a console application (System.in / System.out). Or this can be a RESTful API service. Or something else. We need this abstracted.\n\n\nSo first step would be console (to simplify testing/debugging). I need you to create an app which can be straightforwardly extended to support multiple models with multiple fields. Referencing the model above, I need a way to write something like this:\n\n\nList&lt;Field&gt; addressFields = Arrays.asList(\n\n  new Field(&quot;Entering new address...&quot;, Address::new, required: true, ...),\n\n  new Field(&quot;Please enter street:&quot;, Address::setStreet, required: true, ...),\n\n  new Field(&quot;Please enter street2:&quot;, Address::setStreet2, required: false, ...),\n\n  ...\n\n);  \n\n\nList&lt;Field&gt; clientFields = Arrays.asList(\n\n  new Field(&quot;Entering new client...&quot;, Client::new, required: true, ...),\n\n  new Field(&quot;Please enter client name:&quot;, Client::setName, required: true, ...),\n\n  new Field(&quot;Please enter client address:&quot;, Client::setAddress, fields: addressFields, required: false, ...),\n\n  new Field(&quot;Please enter client orders:&quot;, Client::setOrders, required: false, min: 0, max: 10, ...),\n\n);  \n\n\nClient c = new WorkflowEngine(System.in, System.out).ReadData(clientFields);\n\n\nand this code will write into console something like this (where &quot;&gt;&quot; denotes INPUT data):\n\nEntering new client...\n\nPlease enter client name:\n\n&gt; John\n\nPlease enter client address:\n\n   Entering new address...\n\n   Please enter street:\n\n   &gt; 20 Main St \n\n...\n\n\nand when it's all done, i will have properly populated POJO object in the code.\n\n\n\nthis is just a pseudocode of course but I hope you got the idea.\n\n\nI gave you a very simple set of fields (Client, Address, Order from the example above) but we have about 50 models with 250 fields we need to use. I don't want to use reflection - but I'm okay with entering 1 line per field as show above - and your code must be able to understand when inner field is a complex object (eg Address) or simple one (eg String) and process input/output accordingly.\n\n\nThis all must be done in JAVA 8.\n\n\nI need somebody how can start on this ASAP (like today) and produce working app by the end of the week (so ~40 hours or so).\n\n\nRequirements are quite simple: \n\n* separate POJOs from logic;\n\n* use Lomboc and javax.validation on models (because we already have these models set up like that)\n\n* use reflection (or any other way) to determine attributes (@NotNull, @Size(1, 5), etc) dynamically - so we don't have to re-enter them\n\n* use console for input/output for now (but keep create an interface to hide this)\n\n* ability to resolve optional fields - and input for those may be omitted (eg by reading empty input)\n\n* there will be no circular dependencies \n\n\nPlease let me know if you can start ASAP, if you have any questions, and if you can commit to at least 3 hours interlap with 9am-5pm EST hours.\n\n\n\nNOTE: there is no databases, webservices, etc etc - PURE JAVA project. BUT I do have a requirement to use streams, functional references etc - you must be well aware about functional programming etc because I believe right approach will help to make the final code smaller and easier to understand.\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $27.00-$50.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 08, 2021 00:22 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Back-End Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Java    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Canada\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/URGENT-Need-Java-developer-work-pure-JAVA-proof-concept-workflow-app_%7E014535d4d8c8907295?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "We're a company that records youth games. We have a website that works but needs an overhaul in certain areas:\n\n\nOrder Page: Clients type the information (date, time, place, team name, etc.) of the game that they want us to record.\n\nOnce they do this, they pay by credit card or paypal. We use WooCommerce for this functionality.\n\n\nIssues: \n\n1. Client should be able to type the date or choose from a calendar. So far, choosing is the only option.\n\n2. Client should be able to choose previous dates. \n\n3. When a client needs several games to be recorded, the autofill option fills out all fields when it should be just selected fields.\n\n4. The bulk pricing option used to work and it no longer does.\n\n5. We would like to capture all the client information in a database that we can manipulate to analyse our clients and be able to reachout back to them. We can't do this currently.\n\n\nOnce the client places the order, it goes into a database that we need to be able to sort. \n\nIt is from this database that we assign to the videographers the games that they will record.\n\n\nSince a single order can have several games to record, we need to break this order and list the games in this database individually. \n\n\nWe assign the games to videographers by date and by address (park). \n\n\nWe need assistance with the following tasks:\n\n\n1. The assigning of the games to the videographer is one at a time. We would like to check several games and assign them to a single videographer. Having said this, we need to be able to type individual instructions for each game. if the videographer missed the email, we need to be able to re-send it.\n\n2. If a videographer can't make a specific game, we need to be able to re-assign it to another videographer.\n\n3. The email that the videographer receives does not sort the games chronologically. It also has an awkward layout.\n\n4. Videographer needs to be able to reply to the email to confirm receipt.\n\n\nThere is a lot of coding that is needed to fix these issues. If you're not an expert coder, please don't apply.\n\n\nWe're happy the way it looks but would like to significantly improve the website's backend functionality. Make it as automated as possible with the ability to analyze our clients' info.\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $27.00-$50.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 05, 2021 18:44 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Back-End Development\n<b>Skills</b>:API,     Business Logic Layer,     Automatic Deployment Pipeline,     .NET Framework,     ASP.NET,     ASP.NET MVC,     eCommerce,     HTTP,     SQLite,     Realm Database,     Couchbase,     LevelDB,     Azure Cosmos DB,     PaperDb,     Python,     PHP,     Scala,     Kotlin,     Java,     RESTful API,     Software Architecture & Design,     Database Design,     Database Architecture,     SQL,     Web Services,     Data Access Layer,     Infrastructure as Code,     JavaScript,     CI/CD,     Automatic Test,     Architecture Design    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Developer-needed-help-automate-back-end-processes-Wordpress-website_%7E014e174d09fb980485?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "We are a 3D-printing construction company that has multiple machines that are allocated in work cells. Each work cell is dedicated to a particular manufacturing process. The produced parts have a unique ID number which allows an operator to identify the part and read the data generated during the manufacturing process. All collected information is stored in one database and available via a web portal. \n\nAs the user interface and front-end, we use the ThigsBoard web application, and on the backend, we have AWS instances with Aurora database and IoT gateway. \n\n\nThe current system needs to get a clear user flow with simple access to collected data. A more technical description of the task is listed below: \n\n\nThere are several parts of the system (see picture attached):\n\n- The data logger module. It’s deployed on a dedicated computer on-site. It has a set of drivers to talk to industrial equipment. Then it converts all collected data from the equipment to required formats, packs it, and sends packets to an AWS instance via ThingsbBoard API\n\n\n- The data acquisition module. It’s located on the AWS instance which allows it to receive data from the data logger module and save the data to the database for further processing. Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL is used as a database engine.\n\n\n- The frontend module. It’s located on the same AWS instance which contains a web-server with all necessary web-pages including dashboards, user accounts, data charts, widgets, etc.\n\nThe report generation module. It makes SQL-requests to the database, creates special reports using specific templates, and saves reports on FTP-server.\n\n\n- FTP-server is a storage of all necessary files related to the product.\n\n\nWhat we need:\n\nUsing the ThingsBoard framework create additional web-pages and/or custom widgets that will improve access to data and overall usability, e.g.:\n\n- Show the list of already completed jobs indicating which stages were completed, \n\n- Show the Work in Progress list of jobs indicating at which stage the part is currently is.\n\n- For every part production request need to show what job should be done\n\n- Show parts specification and metadata from database and FTP\n\n- Add fields like “Operator notes/comments” for manual text inputs and adding files, which should be saved into the FTP-server database and associated with a particular part produced\n\n- Push button to generate a new report with the actual data, notes, and attached files\n\n- Show links to files related to the part.\n\n\nWhat we need you to do (should be discussed before execute)\n\n- Create an integrated web-page or a custom widget that allows users to get the list of jobs done with access to necessary information, files, and reports\n\n- Create SQL-requests to get all necessary information from the current Database and to add all new information, links to the database\n\n- Create algorithms to upload files to FTP-server\n\n\nHow we want to check the outcome\n\n- The final result should be a web-portal with multiple pages that allow performing actions described above. \n\n- A user should be able to open added web-pages via the ThingsBoard dashboard.\n\n- The developed web-pages should allow finding the required information or file(s) related to the produced parts.\n\n- Links on web-pages related to produced parts should allow downloading the correct file(s), notes, pictures, and other data, depends on the link context\n\n- Each web-page associated with a produced part should allow information editing such as adding new files, downloading existing files, manually entering notes, generate reports, etc.\n\n\n- The resulting code has to be uploaded to our Github repository. Improvements are deployed to the main server.\n\n\nWe are using the following technologies: \n\n- Amazon EC2 web service is as a back-end engine\n\n- Data processing and visualization is based on the ThingsBoard IoT platform\n\n- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL as a database storage\n\n\nFormat:\n\nWe are working in two-week sprints and the final product should be released by mid-March. We will require to participate in daily 5-10min meetings to coordinate the work with the rest of the team.\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $15.00-$50.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 02, 2021 13:23 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Database Architecture,     Database Design,     Web Application,     API,     Java,     Amazon Aurora,     Responsive Design,     AWS Application    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Russia\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-update-Industrial-IoT-data-dashboard_%7E01e95cf601a41ac2d1?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

One example is sometimes the call drops randomly and sometimes when user A calls user B, it will also call user C who is not even online.\n\n\nWe have investigatedd that these issues are happening because of socket IO is not managed properly along with browser caching issues. Some times the socketIO connection stays on and get conflicted with other users. etc\n\n\nSolution part 1:\n\n\nWe need someone who has extensive knowledge with Socket IO to debug the app and let us know whether the issue is really with socket IO or something else. the main reason for this part of work is to know that you are 100% clear whether you can carry on working and write the code to implement the fixes.\n\n\n\nSolution part  2:\n\n\nOnce you are able to diagnose the issue and tell us that the issue is really with SocketIO and you are 100% clear and able to fix it, Then you will carry on working to implement the fixes so the minimum number of call issues can be resolved.\n\n\n\n\nPlease only apply if you have worked with socket IO before.\n\nMore preferably if you have worked with Vonage API and webRTC\n\n(link removed)\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$45.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 08, 2021 10:14 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:API,     Web Application,     Angular,     AngularJS,     Java,     JavaScript,     Apache HTTP Server,     NGINX,     RESTful,     Node.js,     WebRTC,     Socket.io    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Netherlands\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Socket-and-WEb-RTC-Expert-needed-fix-Real-time-video-calling-features-web-app_%7E01504ab7443397f6d1?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "Hello, \n\n\nMy name is Evan. I am a realtor in Portland OR. I have a website project that I've been working towards starting for a while now, and I'm ready to start, but first I need to find the right developer to work with, and best platform/website that is supported and able to be built in the target destination in Mexico, Merida. What website platforms you're able to build on I think is dependent on what that local MLS supports. I don't quite understand that part, but it sounds like the first bridge that needs to be gapped. This is the first part of the job. \n\n\nI have a large background in online marketing, website development, and content creation. It's always been for a business I was running, and have had to wear a lot of hats. I've had my head out of the SEO, web development space for a few years now, but I am pursuing the plan that got me into real estate which is modeled around ranking a real estate website, and I'm entering back into that head space. \n\n\nThe website, once build, I need to be able to log in, make changes, pages, blogs, etc. I think this excludes a website that is coded from the ground up. I would like it to be on a premium website template. Forgetting terminology on that one. Unless I'm getting something wrong. I have a lot of ideas to implement. This is not going to be the most basic real estate website, so anyone taking on the job has to be very experienced, with many past references/accomplished jobs, and some kind of team for support might help. \n\n\nI'm visiting Merida Mexico on the 19th and will be taking many photos, video, and drone photos for content to start working with. The first part of what I need to do is nail down who I'm going to work with, and the kind of website I'm able to build. \n\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to ready my post. I'm making the job hourly. I think one time payment might work better. I want to hear your proposal on price.  I won't cut quality for price though. \n\n\nBest,\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$45.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 05, 2021 18:55 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Database Architecture,     Database Design,     Web Design,     Website Development,     API,     Adobe Photoshop,     Google Analytics,     Java    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United States\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Developer-needed-for-creating-depth-Mexico-based-Real-Estate-website_%7E01127a1b681fd21c26?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

Please do not apply to this job if you do not have any prior experience and success.\n\n\nThe objective of this project is to build a web calculator that calculates the carbon footprints of an individual or an organisation. Users will login/create an account and answer a series of questions regarding their carbon footprint and will then be presented with a breakdown of their results in the form of graphs/pie-charts with comparisons to the national and worldwide average and some suggestions/tips on what they can do to improve. \n\n\nThe results page will also have a leaderboard amongst friends. Users should be able to input a unique code to join a “league” with friends or colleagues. There will be two types of leaderboards, based on total carbon footprint and biggest improvement.\n\n\nAll users should be able to save their information and be able to go back in at a later date to edit and update as they improve their carbon footprint. \n\n\nThe calculator is to be built on the WordPress platform using PHP/HTML/CSS/Java etc. - we require your proposed method of coding before the project is started. The calculator website needs to be responsive i.e. it needs to work perfectly on laptop, tablet and mobile devices.\n\n\nYou will develop this membership based Carbon Calculator on our development space. \n\n\nWe will provide you with the PowerPoint slides and PDF files with the project scope and requirements. You will also receive the graphics/images to be used, text, calculations, tips and so on.\n\n\nYou are required to provide timely and regular updates on the progression of the project. You need to document your code and work as you go forward with the project. \n\n\nYou will be required to sign an NDA and the project cannot be used in your profile or portfolio or any other websites/emails etc.\n\n\nThe project would be regarded as successful when we receive a responsive and user-friendly Carbon Calculator that strictly adheres to our requirements and is editable from the backend of the site so that it's easy to change formulas without editing code.\n\n\nIn order to be considered, please answer the following fully:\n\nAnswer all points by starting with their respective numbers below:\n\n\n1. Mention the word &quot;sausage&quot; as the first word in your response. Failure to do this will result in your application being declined.\n\n2.

Provide a few examples of your past work involving a Calculator website with links.\n\n3. If you are interested in this job, please don't tell us to refer to your profile, detail in your application, don't simply copy and paste generic information.\n\n\nPeople skills:\n\n1. Ability to communicate effectively\n\n2. Understand written and spoken English to a high level to communicate with the team\n\n\nAbove all, take pride in your work and provide a finished product that enhances you, your team, and the business.\n\n\nProvide a strong cover letter that gives as much detail as possible on how you feel you can help, and what your experience is re. above points.\n\n\nPlease also provide a fixed price.\n\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\n\n\nRegards…\n\nKevin\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$45.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 01, 2021 15:06 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Full Stack Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Database Design,     Website Development    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United Kingdom\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Developer-required-create-website-calculator-system_%7E0197fb4d8db0128d51?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

      "content": "Good morning,\n\nI need an algorithm working on forex and stockmarkets (NASDQ, NYSE and AMEX).\n\nI am looking specifically to a HFT programm, high frequency trading. The algorithm must use the market price of the ticker I would like to trade and autghomatically places an order of buy/sell based on the small movements of the candle.\n\nExample:\n\n\nI choose to trade stock: &quot;x&quot;\n\n\nPrice is at 5$\n\n--&gt; I choose to trade this specific stock\n\n--&gt; Once choosen I set up the cents/pips for the takeProfit and stopLoss \n\n-----&gt; Price is at 5$ =&gt; I set up to sell at 2 cents more and close the position at 2 cents less (ex: 5.02 and 4.98).\n\n!!! important: Once having given these inputs to the algo, the programm must be able to continously follow these instructions and opening and close positions by following the market price and wave. For instance, if the price rises up to 5.50 the algo must be able to open and close positions based on y instructions despite the price has changed.\n\n\nLastly, the programm must work on metatrader 4 and metatrader 5 (MLQ4 and MLQ5). Additionally, I would kindly ask if you are able to write the algorithm also in javascript.\n\n\nObviously, by being different programm languages, the algos must be 3 (one for MLQ4, one for MLQ5 and one in java). Despite this, they must all follow the mentioned above instructions.\n\n\nI'm waiting your kind answer,\n\nThank you \n\nBest regards\n\nFederico\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $30.00-$40.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 04, 2021 18:24 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Scripting & Automation\n<b>Skills</b>:MQL 4,     MetaTrader 4,     Forex Trading,     C,     Algorithm Development    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Italy\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Algorithm-development_%7E01529dab68cbdec6f0?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

The data on the NFC chip is protected and must use BAC authentication using details from the passport to open the chip.\n\n\nThe default Xamarin NFC library we have tried to use doesn't seem to support a way to authenticate BAC authentication (Details on BAC below).\n\n\nThis piece of work requires production of a simple demo Xamarin application that can run on both Android and iOS. Preference is for the developer must have a biometric passport (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport) to allow testing locally. We require development to provide full access to the passport chip in both Android and iOS and to provide a way of accessing this through Xamarin.\n\n\nXamarin application to have three screens\n\n1.

On average 10% of followers like their photo. 3% of follower count comment.\n\nThe tool should then give a health check of the resultant accounts by comparing all the accounts that fulfil those criteria against each other. Best to worst. \n\n\nThis needs to be done beautifully with elegant but simple UI. A table of profile pictures, the account name and link then a star rating. All star ratings should be above 3.5. You click on an account and the following info should be returned.\n\n1. Location of the account / up to 5 of most frequent location tags on their pictures. \n\n2. Top 5 Hashtags used on their account if any.\n\n3. Age of user and average age of followers.\n\n4. Male to Female ratio of account followers/reach.\n\n\nThats it thank you.\n\nYou have 2 weeks max so do the best you can. This will be a prototype. I will ask you to provide screen recordings of time spent coding (i'm not stingy breaks are of course fine) but you will need to evidence you time.\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $25.00-$40.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 01, 2021 21:42 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Desktop Software Development\n<b>Skills</b>:Prototype,     Windows,     Linux,     macOS,     Java,     C++,     Python,     JavaScript,     Very Small (1-9 employees),     Instagram,     Marketing    \n\n<b>Country</b>: United Kingdom\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Digital-Marketing-Tool-Prototype_%7E01c1b6f4ef8af3e217?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

Unfortunately, no unit or integration tests were created at the time and the team in question is expecting a lot of regression should they continue to ramp up development of the system in the future. The project is currently using Flyway for managing its database migrations.\n\n\nWe are therefore looking for a senior developer experienced in Java/Spring and automated QA to help the team...\n\n1) ...choose a strategy for automated integration testing.\n\n2) ...create a basic set-up to run integration tests (on the level of the REST API) as part of CI/CD, preferably using an in-memory database (like H2) and some kind of DB fixture library to isolate the tests from each other as well as from the actual staging/production setup.\n\n3) ...extend the test runner setup to include the measurement of code coverage.\n\n4) ...build more and more integration tests until a certain code coverage has been reached.\n\n\n\nYou will have to sign an NDA before you can start to work on this project. Please don't apply if you're not at least conversational in English and can make yourself available for video calls and Slack chats between 10am and 4pm CET.\n\n\nThere is a possibility that you can join this or another of our teams permanently if the job goes well.\n\n\nHere's how we intend to recruit on this project:\n\n1) You send in your application\n\n2) We provide you with the NDA to sign\n\n3) We provide you with a ZIP file containing a portion of the application's existing codebase (basically a multi-module Maven project). We then ask you to implement 1-2 API-level integration tests as a first test task. \n\n4) You provide us with an estimate of how you think you'll need for this test task, and we award you the contract on Upwork (but capped at the agreed-upon budget, for now). \n\n5) You submit your solution to our test task.\n\n6) We review your solution together with the system architect on client-side and then get back to you with questions as required. \n\n7) If things go as plan we will then lift the budget restriction and onboard you to the project for real (i.e. provide you with access to our VPN, Jira, Gitlab, ect.)\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$35.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 08, 2021 15:55 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Back-End Development\n<b>Skills</b>:RESTful API,     Java,     Git,     Spring Boot,     PostgreSQL,     H2,     JUnit,     CI/CD,     Automatic Test    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Luxembourg\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Java-Spring-developer-help-cover-existing-application-with-integration-amp-unit-tests_%7E01c1cbcac47b6b1aaa?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",

An existing IDA Pro database will be used with many of the function names already translated into more readable English by myself. This should assist with analysing those functions of key interest noted in section 2 of the below list. The application be can be debugged up to a certain point until it requires a file which is missing, e.g. 2.spec.sig. Recreating the functions in C# should assist with further progression.\n\n\nSummary\n\n1.\tTo assist with me with understanding assembly:\n\no\tInterpreting reading/writing of parameters\n\no\tFunction logic\n\no\tWhen structs should be created and how they can be set\n\no\tYour general approach for analysis\n\no\tAnswering any assembly questions which might come up during analysing the functions in section 2 below and developing the C# application\n\n2.\tInterpreting the read functions in assembly which handle the below files and translate to C# (or detailed pseudo code) to be able to read and write these file types:\n\no\tSIG Files\n\no\tVER Files\n\no\tSPEC Files\n\n\nExperienced Individual Requirements\n\nI am seeking someone who fits the following requirements.\n\n•\tExperienced in:\n\no\tIDA Pro\n\no\tAssembly\n\no\tC# - not essential but clear and detailed pseudo code would be required for recreating assembly functions in C#\n\n•\tPaid hourly\n\n•\tPeriod required:\n\no\t&lt; 1 Month (opportunity for further work in the future)\n\no\t5 to 10 hours a week\n\n•\tIdeally available (London Time) sometime between 5pm and 11pm Weekday but can be negotiated\n\n•\tI have setup a VM for development which contains the required tools for analysing assembly, debugging the Gils application, and writing the C# code.

Unfortunately, no unit or integration tests were created at the time and the team in question is expecting a lot of regression should they continue to ramp up development of the system in the future. Furthermore, no database migration framework is currently used on the project and all changes have to be manually applied to the database at the time of a new release.\n\n\nWe are therefore looking for a senior developer experienced in Java/Spring and automated QA to help the team...\n\n1) ...integrate a DB migration framework such as Flyway (https://flywaydb.org/).\n\n2) ...create a basic set-up to run integration tests (on the level of the REST API) as part of CI/CD, preferably using an in-memory database (like H2) and some kind of DB fixtures library to isolate the tests from each other as well as from the actual staging/production setup.\n\n3) ...extend the test runner setup to include the measurement of code coverage.\n\n4) ...build more and more integration tests until a certain code coverage has been reached.\n\n\nYou will have to sign an NDA before you can start to work on this project. Please don't apply if you're not at least conversational in English and can make yourself available for video calls and Slack chats between 10am and 4pm CET.\n\n\nThere is a possibility that you can join this or another of our teams permanently if the job goes well.\n\n<b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$35.00\n\n\n<b>Posted On</b>: February 01, 2021 18:41 UTC\n<b>Category</b>: Back-End Development\n<b>Skills</b>:RESTful API,     Java,     Git,     Spring Boot,     PostgreSQL,     H2,     JUnit,     CI/CD,     Automatic Test    \n\n<b>Country</b>: Luxembourg\n\n<a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Java-Spring-developer-help-cover-existing-application-with-integration-amp-unit-tests_%7E01f739f548c7e2473c?source=rss\">click to apply</a>\n",
